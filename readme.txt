# Pokemon Info Flask Application
This is a simple web application built with Flask, a Python web framework. The application fetches and displays information about a Pokemon when given its name.

## Features
- Fetches Pokemon data from the PokeAPI.
- Displays Pokemon's id, name, height, weight, types, and image.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


# PROMPT ON THE MAIN.PY FILE USING SIDE CHAT:

Create a Flask route "pokemon_names" that fetches Pokémon names from the PokeAPI and returns them as a JSON response. 
Additionally, write a JavaScript function that fetches this list of Pokémon names from the Flask route and populates a datalist element "pokemon_name_list" in an HTML page with these names. 
Ensure the JavaScript function runs when the page loads.
Give the whole code and adjusments on the main.py and index.html file.
